# Tic-Tac-Toe -- With JavaScript Functional Programming 

This is an attempt to tackle a very simple game with most basic features using
javascript functional style.

I am interested in Functional Programming for a long time but from a very
amateurish point of view. I tried some Clojure programming in the past rewriting
some of my existing backend applications but have failed to do it consistently.

My current effort involves building Tic-Tac-Toe game with several languages,
JavaScript being the first one. Those are the languages that I intend to try:

1. Clojure
2. F#
3. ReasonML / OCaml
4. More.
